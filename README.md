This reposity contains files that are linked to my own projects in learning and
teaching in higher education. The .vue files have been created using the Visual
Understanding Environment (VUE) software, which is freely available at
http://vue.tufts.edu. The purpose of sharing these files is to provide
templates and examples for students who are interested in using VUE, and/or who
have watched/are planning to watch my screencast mini-lectures on using VUE.
